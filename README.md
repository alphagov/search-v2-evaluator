# search-v2-evaluator
Internal tool to evaluate results from search-api-v2

This is an MVP replacement for the late [govuk-search-relevance-tool][govuk-search-relevance-tool],
intended to be used for a one-off internal manual testing exercise in advance of the launch of
[search-api-v2][search-api-v2].
